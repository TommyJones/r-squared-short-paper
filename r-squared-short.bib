We propose an R-squared measure of goodness of fit for the class of exponential family regression models, which includes logit, probit, Poisson, geometric, gamma, and exponential. This R-squared is defined as the proportionate reduction in uncertainty, measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence, due to the inclusion of regressors. Under further conditions concerning the conditional mean function it can also be interpreted as the fraction of uncertainty explained by the fitted model.}},

abstract = {{Various R2 statistics have been proposed for logistic regression to quantify the extent to which the binary response can be predicted by a given logistic regression model and covariates. We study the asymptotic properties of three popular variance-based R2 statistics. We find that two variance-based R2 statistics, the sum of squares and the squared Pearson correlation, have identical asymptotic distribution whereas the third one, Gini's concentration measure, has a different asymptotic behaviour and may overstate the predictivity of the model and covariates when the model is misspecified. Our result not only provides a theoretical basis for the findings in previous empirical and numerical work, but also leads to asymptotic confidence intervals. Statistical variability can then be taken into account when assessing the predictive value of a logistic regression model. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

abstract = {{Extensions of linear models are very commonly used in the analysis of biological data. Whereas goodness of fit measures such as the coefficient of determination (R2) or the adjusted R2 are well established for linear models, it is not obvious how such measures should be defined for generalized linear and mixed models. There are by now several proposals but no consensus has yet emerged as to the best unified approach in these settings. In particular, it is an open question how to best account for heteroscedasticity and for covariance among observations present in residual error or induced by random effects. This paper proposes a new approach that addresses this issue and is universally applicable for arbitrary variance‐covariance structures including spatial models and repeated measures. It is exemplified using three biological examples.}},
