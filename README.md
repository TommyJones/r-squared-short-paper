This repo contains a short paper describing a variation on R-squared for multivariate outcomes.  This work was originally derived for topic models. The (as yet unpublished) topic modeling version is [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.11061.pdf). This paper is hopefully destined for a statistics journal and can be used more generally. The calculation described is available in the R Package `mvrsquared`, [available on CRAN.](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mvrsquared).
