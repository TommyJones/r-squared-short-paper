Dear Professor Cook,
\bigskip

Please consider our article titled "A New (Old) Goodness of Fit Metric for Multidimensional Outcomes" for publication in the R Journal.

The manuscript introduces an extension of the canonical R-squared calculation and an accompanying package, `mvrsquared`. We use a geometric interpretation of the traditional R-squared definition to generalize it for calculating goodness of fit for multivariate prediction (where one observed outcome is in multiple dimensions). We provide results of applying our calculation on 4 use cases as well as examples on how to use the `mvrsquared` package.

We believe the readers of the R Journal will find this article helpful for their work because it provides them a means to calculate a well-known "sanity check" metric for complex models, making complex results more accessible to audiences.
